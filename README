RobustIMC
------------

Write "json", send IMC message, and enjoy the benefit from IMC!


Technical details

1. The entry point is %gameDir%/config/robustimc.json
   where %gameDir% is your main game directory
2. Even though it says json format above, there is still a
   significant difference; that said, this file shall not
   use quotation mark to enclose all key, e.g.:

   ````
   {
     example_object: {
       string: "I am string",
       number: 42,
       array: ["I", "am", "string", "array"],
       boolean: true,
       float_point: 233.33
     }
   }
   ````

   This is due to how Minecraft works. If you are familiar
   with command block stuff, you will recognize this format
   very quickly.
3. The exact meaning of message depends on actual implementation
   entirely. Please ask mod dev if your message is successfully
   sent but not functional.
